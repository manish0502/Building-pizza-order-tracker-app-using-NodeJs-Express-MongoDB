### What follows is a brief description of each entry, but most directories contain their own README.md file with additional documentation, so browse around to learn more.

 * `karma/ `- test configuration.
 * `src/ `- our application sources. Read more Â»
 * `vendor/` - third-party libraries. Bower will install packages here. Anything added to this directory will need to be manually added to build.config.js and *  *`karma/karma`-unit.js to be picked up by the build system.
 * `.bowerrc` - the Bower configuration file. This tells Bower to install components into the vendor/ directory.
 *` bower.json` - this is our project configuration for Bower and it contains the list of Bower dependencies we need.
 * `build.config.js` - our customizable build settings; see "The Build System" below.
 * `module.prefix and module.suffix` - our compiled application script is wrapped in these, which by default are used to place the application inside a self-    
 * `package.json` - metadata about the app, used by NPM and our build script. Our NPM dependencies are listed here.
